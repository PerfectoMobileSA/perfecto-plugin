    Creates a key which expires after a set time for more security. This will limit any potential exposure if your access key is discovered or disclosed. The default expiration setting is 120 minutes. Since self-expiring access keys are generated once per Jenkins job we recommend you set a timeout length longer than your average Jenkins job time.
